+ Proposal: Token Sale for 60K Tokens as Part of Company Valuation

** Introduction

As our project continues to grow and evolve, we have reached a significant milestone that requires
our attention. The sale of a portion of the company, specifically 60%, will be achieved through the
issuance of 60,000 tokens. This proposal outlines the rationale behind this decision, the valuation
of the company, and the process for conducting a fair and transparent token sale.

** Company Valuation

Before proceeding with the sale, it is essential to establish a clear understanding of the company's
value. To achieve this, we propose forming a business plan workgroup (W1) led by our ontology
leadership team (T1). This group will be responsible for conducting market research, analyzing
financials, and developing a comprehensive valuation model.

*** Objectives of W1:

1. *Market Research:* Gather data on similar projects in the NFT and AI domains to establish a
benchmark for our company's value.
2. *Financial Analysis:* Review the company's current financials, including revenue streams,
expenses, and projected growth.
3. *Valuation Model:* Develop a robust valuation model that takes into account all relevant factors,
such as market position, technological advantage, and potential for future growth.

*** Leadership Team (T1):

- *Dr. Emily Wang (Chief Economist):* Expertise in valuation and financial analysis.
- *Mr. John Doe (Chief Marketing Officer):* Knowledge of market trends and brand value.
- *Ms. Jane Smith (Technical Lead):* Understanding of the technology's potential and its competitive
   landscape.

** Token Sale Process

Once the business plan workgroup has established a clear valuation, we will proceed with the token
sale. The process will be transparent and inclusive, ensuring that all stakeholders are involved in
the decision-making process.

*** Steps for Token Sale:

1. *Forming a Voting Committee:* We will form a committee of existing token holders to review the
proposal and make a decision.
2. *Token Offering Terms:* Define the terms of the token offering, including the number of tokens
available (60,000), the price per token ($2,000), and the total value of the token sale ($120
million).
3. *Marketing Campaign:* Launch a marketing campaign to inform potential buyers about the
opportunity to invest in our company.
4. *Subscription Period:* Establish a subscription period during which investors can purchase
tokens.
5. *Token Distribution:* After the subscription period, distribute the tokens to investors based on
their purchase orders.

*** Stakeholder Considerations:

- *Founders and Investors:* Ensure that the token sale does not dilute existing stakehold er
   interests significantly.
- *New Investors:* Protect new investors by establishing clear terms and conditions for token
   purchases.
- *AI Integration:* The proceeds from the token sale will be used to fund NFT hosting, AI
   development, and marketing efforts.

** Proposal Approval

We propose that our leadership team and stakeholders review this proposal and provide feedback. We
believe that forming a business plan workgroup (W1) with an ontology leadership team (T1) will help
us establish a fair valuation for the company and ensure a transparent token sale process.

*Next Steps:*

1. *Form W1:* Begin formation of the business plan workgroup with leadership team T1.
2. *Market Research:* Initiate market research to gather data on similar projects in the NFT and AI
domains.
3. *Financial Analysis:* Conduct a comprehensive financial analysis of our company's current
position and future prospects.
4. *Valuation Model Development:* Develop a robust valuation model based on all relevant factors.

We look forward to your feedback and participation in this important decision for our project's
growth.
